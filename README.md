# Welcome

First of all, thank you. We know it's not easy to take time out of your weekend, so we're grateful you decided to trust we'll make it worth it :-)

## What we'll build

Throughout this workshop, we'll build a light version of IMDB (_Internet Movie Database_), a place where we'll keep a record of our favorite TV Shows or movies.

It'll be something simple yet powerful enough to teach you the core concepts of building apps with Firebase and Angular.

You'll learn:

- How to connect your app with Firebase.
- How to fetch a list of items from Firebase and display them on the screen.
- How to create a new item and add it to that list.
- How to edit one of those items.
- How to delete one of those items.

In other words, you'll leave this workshop with the ability to interact with your Firebase database (_we'll use the new Firestore DB_) and handle all CRUD operations (_Create, Read, Update, and Delete_).

## Before we get started

We want you to know a few things:

- All the mentors came here for you, so please, feel free to call them and ask them as many questions as you want :-)
- We want to make sure that everyone finishes the workshop, so if you finish one of the steps, do take a look around your table to see if you can help anyone else before moving to the next step.
- We'll have a short intro at the beginning of each exercise, and a short recap at the end.

That's it, have a wonderful time and remember, we're here for you :-)
